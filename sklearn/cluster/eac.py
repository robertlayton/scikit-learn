    """Perform EAC clustering from vector array or distance matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array [n_samples, n_samples] or [n_samples, n_features]
        Array of distances between samples, or a feature array.
        The array is treated as a feature array unless the metric is given as
        'precomputed'.
    initial_clusterers: iterable, or None
        The clusterers used in the first step of the process. If an iterable is
        given, then each one is called. If None is given (default), 150 runs of
        k-means with k randomly selected between 10 and 30 are used.
    final_clusterer: model (extends ClusterMixin), or None
        The clusterer to apply to the final clustering matrix. The method must
        be able to take a coassociation matrix as input, which is an array of
        size [n_samples, n_samples].
        If None, the default model is used, which is MST.
    use_distance: boolean, or callable TODO: default should be false
        If True, convert the coassociation matrix to distance using
        `D=1./(C + 1)`. If callable, the function is called with the
        coassociation matrix as input. If False (default), then the matrix is
        given as input to the `final_clusterer`.
    random_state: numpy.RandomState, optional
        The generator used to initialize the initial_clusterers.
        Defaults to numpy.random.

    Returns
    -------
    final_model: model (extends ClusterMixin)
        The model given as `final_clusterer`, fitted with the evidence
        accumulated through this process.

    """Perform EAC clustering from vector array or distance matrix.

    Evidence Accumulation Clustering (EAC) is an ensemble cluster that uses
    many iterations of k-means with randomly chosen k values (``n_clusters``)
    each time. The number of times two instances are clustered together is
    given in a co-association matrix, which is then clustered a final time to
    produce the 'final clustering'. In practice, this gives a more easily
    separable set of attributes that the original attributes.
    

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array [n_samples, n_samples] or [n_samples, n_features]
        Array of distances between samples, or a feature array.
        The array is treated as a feature array unless the metric is given as
        'precomputed'.
    initial_clusterers: iterable, or None

        be able to take a coassociation matrix as input, which is an array of
        size [n_samples, n_samples].
        If None, the default model is used, which is MST.
    use_distance: boolean, or callable
        If True, convert the coassociation matrix to distance using
        `D=1./(C + 1)`. If callable, the function is called with the
        coassication matrix as input. If False (default), then the matrix is
        given as input to the `final_clusterer`.
    random_state: numpy.RandomState, optional
        The generator used to initialize the initial_clusterers.
        Defaults to numpy.random.

    Attributes
    ----------
    final_clusterer: model (same as the parameter final_clusterer)
        The clusterer given as a parameter, now fit to the evidence
        accumulation from learning.

    `labels_` : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Cluster labels for each point in the dataset given to fit().
        Same as the self.final_clusterer.labels_
